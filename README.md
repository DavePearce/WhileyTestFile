# WhileyTestFile

A library for parsing Whiley test files according to
[RFC#110](https://github.com/Whiley/RFCs/blob/master/text/0110-test-file-format.md)
which are used for testing the [Whiley
compiler](https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler).  Each test
describes a sequence of modifications to one of more Whiley files,
along with the expected outcomes (e.g. errors, warnings, etc).  An
example test file is the following:

```
whiley.verify = false
boogie.timeout = 1000
================
>>> main.whiley
method main():
>>> other.whiley
import main
---
E101 main.whiley 1,2
E302 main.whiley 2,2:3
================
<<< other.whiley
>>> main.whiley 1:1
method main()
    skip
---
```

This is a test involving two files: `main.whiley` and `other.whiley`.
The initial frame sets the contents of `main.whiley` to `method
main()` and the contents of `other.whiley` to `import main`.
Furthermore, compiling this frame is expected to produce two errors
(`E101` and `E302`).  The second frame deletes file `other.whiley` and
updates the contents of `main.whiley`.  Furthermore, compiling the
snapshot at this point is not expected to produce any errors.

## Usage

```Rust
use std::fs;
use whiley_test_file::WhileyTestFile;
//!
fn load(filename: &str) {
    // Read the test file
    let input = fs::read_to_string(filename).unwrap();
    // Parse test file
    let test_file = WhileyTestFile::new(&input).unwrap();
    // ...
}
```

This simply reads a file from disk and parses it as a
`WhileyTestFile`, expecting this all to succeed.
